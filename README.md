## 🚀 Quick Start (Self-Hosted)

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended.
- Active internet connection (for BTC price APIs).

### 2. Setup

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennj75/beesy.git
cd beesy

If you just downloaded Beesy, follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Create a virtual environment (first time only)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
py -m venv .venv

2. Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application
python app.py

Open your browser and go to:

👉 http://localhost:5000

💡 Common Problems (Troubleshooting)

ModuleNotFoundError

If you receive this error, it means some dependencies are missing.
Make sure you have installed them with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## 🧪 "Nostr" & Mobile Laboratory

⚡ **Nostr Authentication: The Magic of Amber**
<strong style="color: #f39c12">₿eesy</strong> leverages the power of the Nostr protocol to provide a secure, password-less experience.

- **Desktop:** Use any NIP-07 browser extension (like nos2x or Alby).
- **Mobile (Amber):** On Android, <strong style="color: #f39c12">₿eesy</strong> triggers an Android Intent. Amber pops up, you approve the signature, and you are logged in. Your private key never touches our code.

## 🔏 The "Privacy-First" Laboratory

🛡️ **Backup & Restore**
We implemented a robust backup system to ensure you never lose your data:

- **Traditional Users:** Your backup is encrypted using a Master Key derived from your password. Even if someone steals your backup file, they cannot read it without your Beesy password.
- **Nostr Users:** Quick JSON export/import for seamless identity portability.
- **Mobile Ready:** Restore your history directly from your smartphone browser with 100% success rate on traditional accounts.

## 🛠️ Roadmap & Contributions

- [x] **Encrypted Backup & Restore:** Fully functional on PC and Mobile.
- [x] **Advanced Analytics:** Real-time visual dashboards (Chart.js).
- [x] **Plug & Play DB:** Automatic database and table creation on first run.

## 👨‍💻 Behind the Code: A "Vibe Coding" Story

This project is a labor of love by a **self-taught developer**.

- **Learning by doing:** ₿eesy is my first major project shared on GitHub.
- **Bitcoin in my heart:** I built this because Bitcoin is a fundamental part of my journey.
- **Vibe Coding:** I believe in building software that feels right, iterating quickly, and learning through the "vibe" of the development process.
